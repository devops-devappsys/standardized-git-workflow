### **1. Code of Conduct**

Please note that we have adopted a **[Code of Conduct](./.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)** to ensure a welcoming and respectful environment for all contributors. Please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

---

### **2. How to Contribute**

We accept contributions in many forms, including:

- Reporting bugs and suggesting features.
- Submitting fixes and new features via pull requests.
- Improving documentation.
  
If you want to contribute code, please follow the guidelines outlined below to ensure consistency.

---

### **3. Setting Up the Development Environment**

Before you start contributing, you will need to set up the project locally. Follow these steps:

1. **Fork the repository** to your own GitHub account.
2. **Clone your fork**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/standardized-git-workflow.git
   cd standardized-git-workflow
   ```
3. **Install dependencies** (example for Node.js projects):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. **Create a feature branch** based on the development branch (see branching strategy below).

---

### **4. Branching and Development Workflow**

We follow the **Git Flow** branching model. Here's how to contribute:

- **Main Branches**:
  - `main`: Production-ready code.
  - `develop`: Ongoing development for the next release.

- **Feature Branches**:
  - New features or bug fixes should be done in branches starting with `feature/`.
  - Example: `feature/user-authentication`.

- **Workflow**:
  1. Create a new branch:
     ```bash
     git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name develop
     ```
  2. Make changes and commit (see commit message guidelines).
  3. Push the branch to your fork:
     ```bash
     git push origin feature/your-feature-name
     ```
  4. Open a Pull Request (PR) targeting `develop`.

---

### **5. Commit Message Guidelines**

We follow the **Conventional Commits** specification for commit messages to create readable and traceable commit history.

**Commit Format**:
```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
```

- **Type**:
  - `feat`: A new feature.
  - `fix`: A bug fix.
  - `docs`: Changes to documentation.
  - `style`: Code formatting changes (no functional change).
  - `refactor`: Code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature.
  - `test`: Adding or fixing tests.
  - `chore`: Maintenance tasks like updating dependencies.
  
- **Example**:
  ```
  feat(api): add user authentication
  fix(database): resolve query timeout issue
  ```

**Additional Notes**:
- Limit the subject line to 72 characters.
- Use the present tense ("fix" not "fixed", "add" not "added").
- Use an imperative mood in the subject.

---

### **6. Pull Request Process**

To submit a pull request:

1. **Ensure all tests pass** before submitting a PR.
2. **Follow the PR template** (it will auto-populate when you open a PR):
   - Clearly describe the purpose of the PR.
   - Link any related issue(s).
   - Provide relevant tests if introducing a new feature or fix.
3. **Request a review**:
   - One team member should review your PR.
   - Ensure all comments are addressed before merging.

### **7. Issue Reporting**

If you encounter a bug or have a feature request, please open an issue using one of our templates:

- **Bug Report**: Describe the issue in detail, including steps to reproduce, expected behavior, and screenshots if possible.
- **Feature Request**: Suggest new features and provide use cases.

---

### **8. Code Style and Linting**

We use a linter to enforce code consistency across the project. Make sure you run the linter before committing your code.

- **Lint your code** before committing:
  ```bash
  npm run lint
  ```
- If the linter throws any errors, fix them before pushing your changes.

---

### **9. Testing**

Please ensure your code is tested before submitting a PR.

- **Unit Tests**: Make sure to write unit tests for any new functionality.
- **Run tests locally** before pushing your code:
  ```bash
  npm test
  ```
  
All PRs should pass automated tests before merging.

---

### **10. Code Reviews**

All code submissions must go through the review process. Here's how it works:

- One or more team members will review your code.
- You will receive feedback in the form of comments on your PR.
- Once all feedback is addressed and all tests pass, the PR will be merged.
